Fun with Forth

LeapYear.fs

Sample Forth code that determines whether or not a number would be a leap year.

A year is a Leap Year if:

    It is evenly divisible by 1000 and is evenly disible by 400
    (If it is evenly dividble by 1000 and NOT evenly divisible by 400. then it is NOT a Leap Year)

    Otherwise, if it is evenly divisible by 4, it is a Leap Year.

PLEASE NOTE - I Just learned Forth in the last month or so. This is probably not ideally written Forth code.
I'm sharing this becausse rthere is so little doumentation and samples for Forth out there.
I'm not sure what made me look at Forth, but I was instantly hooked when I started playing with it.
There are few real-life situations that need forth for the average person - even the average programmer.
But evey task you come up with to try to solve with Forth becomes a logic puzzle that is so fun to
solve and so satisfying when completed.

Have fun with Forth!!!
